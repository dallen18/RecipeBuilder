    <h3>What are weight loss-friendly recipes?</h3>
    <p>Grilled chicken with steamed veggies;
       Quinoa and black bean salad;
       Green smoothie with spinach, kale, apple, banana, and almond milk.</p>
    <h3>How much protein should I include in my weight loss recipes?</h3>
    <p>Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth, and it can help you feel full longer. Aim for a protein source at every meal, such as lean meats, fish, beans, or tofu. The specific amount depends on your individual needs, activity level, and goals. Typically, a general guideline is 0.8 to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, but it's best to consult with a nutritionist to tailor it to your needs.</p>
    <h3>Should I eliminate carbs for weight loss?</h3>
    <p>No need to cut all carbs. Focus on complex carbs like sweet potatoes, brown rice, and whole grains over refined ones.</p>
    <h3>Is it okay to use oils and fats in weight loss recipes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, but choose healthy sources and monitor portion sizes. Fats are essential for nutrient absorption and satiety. Opt for unsaturated fats from sources like olive oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds. Remember, fats are calorie-dense, so use them in moderation to keep your meal within your calorie goals. Avoid trans fats and limit saturated fats.</p>
