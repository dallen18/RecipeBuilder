# Twelve Tomatoes

This project aims to create an all-encompassing web portal for food enthusiasts, introducing innovative features to
enhance the culinary experience. Beyond suggesting recipes based on available ingredients, the portal offers diverse
search options, explores local restaurants with direct Yelp links, and provides functionality for printing and saving
favorite recipes. Additional features include user-generated recipes, cooking tips, techniques, regular updates, and
multimedia elements such as related videos. Users can seamlessly navigate the portal, enjoying a holistic food
experience, and even opt for food delivery from top-rated local restaurants. The selection of this project stems from
its universal appeal, as everyone engages in eating. This broad user base presents a significant outreach opportunity.
Current websites in this domain lack the comprehensive functionalities we aim to implement, making it a valuable venture
to address existing gaps and provide an enriched user experience.
