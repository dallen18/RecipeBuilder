# RecipeBuilder
This project aims to create an all-encompassing web portal for food enthusiasts, introducing innovative features to enhance the culinary experience. Beyond suggesting recipes based on available ingredients, the portal offers diverse search options, explores local restaurants with direct Yelp links, and provides functionality for printing and saving favorite recipes. Additional features include user-generated recipes, cooking tips, techniques, regular updates, and multimedia elements such as related videos. Users can seamlessly navigate the portal, enjoying a holistic food experience, and even opt for food delivery from top-rated local restaurants. The selection of this project stems from its universal appeal, as everyone engages in eating. This broad user base presents a significant outreach opportunity. Current websites in this domain lack the comprehensive functionalities we aim to implement, making it a valuable venture to address existing gaps and provide an enriched user experience.
